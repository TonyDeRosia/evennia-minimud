"""One time initial setup hooks.

``at_initial_setup`` is only executed onceâ€”the very first time the
game's database is created.  Common actions include generating starting
rooms, populating default game objects or creating an administrator
account.  Because it only fires once, mistakes made here require a
database reset to run again, so test carefully.
