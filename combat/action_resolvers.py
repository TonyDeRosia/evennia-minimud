"""Resolve combat action results and update participant state.

The :class:`~combat.damage_processor.DamageProcessor` executes actions
for each :class:`~combat.combatants.CombatParticipant` in turn. Those
actions return :class:`~combat.combat_actions.CombatResult` objects that
describe the outcome â€“ damage dealt, messages to display and the target
affected. This module contains helpers that take those results and apply
them to the game world.

``resolve_combat_result`` is called by ``DamageProcessor`` after each
action. It applies damage, buffers combat messages and records aggro for
the attacker. When a target's health drops to zero it delegates defeat
handling to ``DamageProcessor.handle_defeat`` and cleans up any pending
actions that reference the defeated participant.
